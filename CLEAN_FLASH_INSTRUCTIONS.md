# Clean Factory Image Flash for Pixel 3a - Do this first

Given that this device previously had development tools, we should flash a completely clean factory image.

## Current Device Info:
- Android 12, Build: SP2A.220505.008
- Security patch: May 5, 2022

## Download Factory Image Manually:
1. Go to: https://developers.google.com/android/images#sargo
2. Find build **SP2A.220505.008** 
3. Download the factory image ZIP
4. Extract it to this folder

## Then Run Flash Script:
Once you have the factory image, we'll create a script to:
1. Flash all partitions cleanly
2. Wipe userdata completely  
3. Ensure no traces of previous modifications remain

This will give you a 100% clean device before we proceed with rooting.

Would you like to download the factory image manually, or should we try a different approach?
